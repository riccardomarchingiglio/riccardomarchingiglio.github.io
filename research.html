				<p> I study how the availability of information about workers' criminal background affects the choice of working in a licensed occupation. Intuitively, under asymmetric information, and when the acquisition of a license is more costly for people with criminal records, statistical discrimination against groups with higher crime rates creates an incentive for their members to signal a clean record by acquiring a license. Exploiting Ban-the-Box laws as a source of variation in the availability of information, I show evidence that workers in minority groups with high crime rates  are more likely to own a license when employersâ€™ ability to inquire about criminal records is limited. </p>

				<p> We study the relationship between local corruption and income misreporting in the context of the EITC program, using a newly assembled dataset of corruption at the MSA level. Using a research design that exploits exogenous variation in institutional accountability, we find causal evidence that our corruption measure affects sharp bunching among self-employed. </p>
