        		<h2>Work in progress</h2>
				<p> Prison labor and the labor market outcomes of ex-convicts </p>
				<p> Prolonged idleness can cause the value of a worker's marginal product to depreciate, leading to worse labor market outcomes. I study the labor market consequences of prison labor in 1920-40s U.S., observing former inmates upon release. To identify the causal effect of working during prison time on labor market outcomes upon release, I use location-specific time variation in the exposure to the supply of workers in the free market when the inmate is in prison, holding fixed the local labor market conditions after release, leveraging the substitutability between prison labor and free labor. </p>
				<p> Diversity in schools: the effect of immigrant peers on native students' performance (with <a href="https://www.sesp.northwestern.edu/profile/?p=19627">David Figlio</a>, <a href="https://www.anderson.ucla.edu/faculty_pages/paola.giuliano/">Paola Giuliano</a>, <a href="https://www.air.org/person/umut-ozek">Umut Ozek</a>, and <a href="https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/sapienza/htm/research.htm">Paola Sapienza</a>) </p>
				<p> We identify the impact of the cumulative exposure to immigrants throughout a native student's school career, using a research design that exploits variation across siblings, holding the family's life-cycle fixed. To overcome possible within-family endogeneity related to unobserved heterogeneity across siblings, we develop a novel identification strategy that relies on the estimation of empirical Markov chain matrices of school-to-school transitions. </p>
			<h2>Working papers</h2>
				<p> <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/kkx28n3t690vb8p/OccLic_StatDisc_jan-19.pdf?raw=1"> Statistical discrimination and the choice of licensing: Evidence from Ban-the-Box Laws</a> <i>R&R at <b>Labour Economics</b></i> </p>
				<p> I study how the availability of information about workers' criminal background affects the choice of working in a licensed occupation. Intuitively, under asymmetric information, and when the acquisition of a license is more costly for people with criminal records, statistical discrimination against groups with higher crime rates creates an incentive for their members to signal a clean record by acquiring a license. Exploiting Ban-the-Box laws as a source of variation in the availability of information, I show evidence that workers in minority groups with high crime rates  are more likely to own a license when employersâ€™ ability to inquire about criminal records is limited. </p>
				<p> Public school spending and human capital under limited suffrage: the role of teachers in 1860s Italy [New draft coming soon!] </p>
				<p> What types of institutional design have favored investment in public education under restricted suffrage? How does expenditure on public schools translate into supply of public education and affect basic human capital formation? Using data from the universe of elementary schools in post-unitary Italy, an ideal laboratory given its brand new institutional design, I provide evidence of the remarkable political role of teachers and causal estimates of the impact of local spending on public schools on the diffusion of basic human capital. </p>
				<p> <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/0h6xzlhk686up94/Corruption_EITC_feb-19.pdf?raw=1"> Local corruption and misreported income: Evidence from the Earned Income Tax Credit </a> (with <a href="https://sites.northwestern.edu/eberkes/">Enrico Berkes</a>) </p>
				<p> We study the relationship between local corruption and income misreporting in the context of the EITC program, using a newly assembled dataset of corruption at the MSA level. Using a research design that exploits exogenous variation in institutional accountability, we find causal evidence that our corruption measure affects sharp bunching among self-employed. </p>
